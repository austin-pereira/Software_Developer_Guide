# Software_Developer_Guide



## Introduction
This repository serves as my personal notebook for software development. It includes notes, helpful links, code snippets, and resources that I've collected over my learning journey. This digital notebook is structured to facilitate quick references and organized learning.



## Topics
Here I categorize notes by topics such as JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development. Each folder represents a different subject area or project.

### Examples:
- JavaScript
  - [Async/Await Essentials](./JavaScript/Async_Await.md)
  - [Framework Comparisons](./JavaScript/Frameworks.md)
- Python
  - [Data Science Tips](./Python/Data_Science.md)
  - [Decorators Demystified](./Python/Decorators.md)

## Resources
Links to external resources, tutorials, and courses that have been useful in my development journey. Here, I also include brief descriptions or summaries about why a particular resource is valuable.



## Code Snippets
This section includes reusable code snippets that I've either developed or adapted from other sources. These are organized by language and functionality.

### Examples:
- Python
  - [Quick Sort Algorithm](./Code_Snippets/Python/Quick_Sort.py)
- JavaScript
  - [DOM Manipulation Basics](./Code_Snippets/JavaScript/DOM_Basics.js)
